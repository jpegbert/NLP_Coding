#### Miscellaneous functions

# According to https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/17199, this decorator
# is necessary to make fork() and openmp work together.
#
# TODO: confirm if this is necessary for MXNet and Tensorflow.  If so, we need
# to standardize worker process creation since our operators are implemented with
# OpenMP.
